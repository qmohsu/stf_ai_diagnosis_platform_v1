feat(app-11): integrate dify workflow and tools

Enables "No-Code" orchestration by exposing diagnostic tools and configuring the Dify local environment.

Changes:
- API: Added `/v1/tools/redact` and `/v1/tools/validate-vin` endpoints.
- Dify: Added `dify/diagnosis_workflow.yml` specification.
- Infra: Configured Dify containers (Split-Horizon DNS for local access).
- Infra: Applied initial database migrations for Dify.

Why:
- Allows non-engineers to modify the diagnostic prompt flow visually.
- Decouples atomic tools (Redaction, Validation) from the orchestration logic.

Troubleshooting:
- Fixed `CONSOLE_API_URL` vs `APP_API_URL` mismatch for local development.
- Fixed missing DB tables by running manual migration.
