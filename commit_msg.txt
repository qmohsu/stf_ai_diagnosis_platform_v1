feat(app-10): implement daily diagnostic reporting

Implements a batch reporting job to aggregate diagnostic activity, risk trends, and technician feedback.

Changes:
- Service: Added `DailyReporter` to aggregate DB stats.
- Script: Added `generate_daily_report.py` CLI tool.

Why:
- **Observability**: Transforms raw DB rows into actionable daily metrics.
- **Risk Tracking**: Automatically flags high-risk sessions and common faults (e.g., "P0300 spike").
- **Quality Control**: Monitors average technician ratings to detect model degradation.

Impact:
Enables shop managers to view daily performance snapshots and identify systemic vehicle issues or AI model drifts without direct DB access.
