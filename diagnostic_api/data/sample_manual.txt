## Section 3.2: Fuel System Troubleshooting

### P0171 - System Too Lean (Bank 1)
This code indicates that the fuel system is running weak or a vacuum leak exists.

**Possible Causes:**
1.  **Vacuum Leaks:** Check intake manifold gaskets, vacuum hoses, and PCV valve.
2.  **Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor:** A dirty or defective MAF sensor can cause lean conditions. Clean with specialized cleaner.
3.  **Fuel Injectors:** Clogged injectors restricts fuel flow.
4.  **Fuel Pump:** Low fuel pressure.

**Diagnostic Procedure:**
1.  Connect diagnostic tool and read fuel trims.
2.  If Short Term Fuel Trim (STFT) is high (>10%) at idle but drops at higher RPM, suspect a vacuum leak.
3.  If STFT stays high at all RPMs, suspect fuel delivery issues or MAF sensor.

### P0300 - Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire
Indicates misfires detected in multiple cylinders.

**Possible Causes:**
- Worn spark plugs
- Failed ignition coils
- Vacuum leaks
- Low fuel pressure
